|SNSlong| Programming with the |sdk-net|
########################################

The |sdk-net| supports |SNSlong| (|SNS|), which is a web service that enables applications,
end-users, and devices to instantly send and receive notifications from the cloud. For more
information, see |SNS|_.

The following information introduces you to the |SNS| programming models in the the SDK.

.. _sns-apis-intro-models:

Programming Models
==================

The the SDK provides two programming models for working with |SNS|. These programming models are
known as the *low-level* and *resource* models. The following information describes these models,
how to use them, and why you would want to use them.

.. _sns-apis-intro-low-level:

Low-Level APIs
--------------

The SDK provides low-level APIs for programming with |SNS|. These low-level APIs typically
consist of sets of matching request-and-response objects that correspond to HTTP-based API calls
focusing on their corresponding service-level constructs.

The following example shows how to use the low-level APIs to list accessible topics in |SNS|:

.. literalinclude:: how-to/sns/sns-list-topics-low-level.txt
   :language: csharp

For related API reference information, see :code:`Amazon.SimpleNotificationService`,
:code:`Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.Model`, and :code:`Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.Util` in
the |sdk-net-api|_..


.. _sns-apis-intro-resource-level:

Resource APIs
-------------

The the SDK provides the AWS Resource APIs for .NET for programming with |SNS|. These resource APIs
provide a resource-level programming model that enables you to write code to work more directly with
|SNS| resources as compared to their low-level API counterparts. (For more information about the AWS
Resource APIs for .NET, including how to download and reference these resource APIs, see
:ref:`resource-level-apis-intro`.)

The following example shows how to use the AWS Resource APIs for .NET to list accessible topics in
|SNS|:

.. literalinclude:: how-to/sns/sns-list-topics-resource-level.txt

For related API reference information, see :sdk-net-api-v2:`Amazon.SNS.Resources <NSNSResourcesNET45>`.
